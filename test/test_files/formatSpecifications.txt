Per-player should contain all the elements a player would have, example, weapons, wins, etc

Getting a sublist must be explicitly mentioned as "sublist". Example: constants.weapons.sublist.name

When referring to a list, eg. - weapons in constants, the full path must be specified i.e. constants.weapons
The result field in input choice, will always assume that it is an element of player, so "player.weapon" should be only "weapon"
Same applied to "to" in add rule. Basically, if anything refers to an element from the parent rule, sinze the element is being passed down
in the implementation, we can assume that it is referring to that element.
So for add rule, "winner.wins" should just be "wins"

All operations such as collect, size, etc. must be preceded with '->'
