////////////// These are specifications for the json files. Subject to change. ///////////////


Per-player should contain all the elements a player would have, example, weapons, wins, etc

Getting a sublist must be explicitly mentioned as "sublist". Example: constants.weapons.sublist.name

When referring to a list, eg. - weapons in constants, the full path must be specified i.e. constants.weapons

"configuration" need not be specified as it is not a seperate struct. so it should be "setup.Round.upfrom(1)"

condition must always be a string
